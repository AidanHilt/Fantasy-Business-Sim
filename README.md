# Fantasy-Business-Sim
This program was designed as a simple accompaniment for to game masters looking to allow their players run businesses for tabletop RPGs. It is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript,
using Electron to allow it to run on desktop. If started with npm start, or from a built executable, it can currently read information on a business from a file called
defauled_business.json. It supports the user adding expenses to the business that can reoccur daily, monthly, or weekly, as well as items that the business sells. It also allows
users to affect the business's fame and reputation, which will be used to determine how many customers come into the establishment.
